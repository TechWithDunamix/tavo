Implement: docs/deployment.md

# TASK
Implement the file `docs/deployment.md` for the Bino full-stack framework.

# OVERVIEW
Docs: deploying built output to platforms (Docker, systemd, cloud providers).

# CONTEXT
- Project: Bino (Python backend + Rust/SWC React SSR)
- This file should follow Python 3.11+ idioms (async where appropriate) and be well documented.
- Prefer small, testable functions. Provide basic error handling and logging.
- If this file is a CLI command: do not start a blocking server â€” only implement the command's logic and an entrypoint function.
- If this file calls external tools (npm, rust bundler), expose clear functions and do not execute them on import.

# REQUIREMENTS
- Add docstrings.
- Add type annotations.
- Use Starlette-compatible request/response for API route handlers.
- For any filesystem paths, use pathlib.
- Include comments where a future developer must implement real logic (e.g., `# TODO: implement real compiler invocation`).
- Keep the file under 400 lines of code.
- Add a short usage example at the bottom in a `if __name__ == '__main__':` block when appropriate.

# TESTS
Suggest 2-3 unit tests as comments or doctests for critical functions.

# OUTPUT
Return only the source code or file content (no extra wrapper text).
